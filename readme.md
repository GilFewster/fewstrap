## This probably isn't the Generator you're looking for
This is just a super-simple little generator for bootstrapping a basic project setup with some gitignore and eslint settings that I like to use.

It might grow over time, but it's unlikely to be useful for most folks.

### V2.0 update 
Version 2.x includes
* webpack setup and build pipeline with babel, sass/css and autoprefixer
* ability to install project files in either the PWD, or a new subdirectory within the PWD. Option is selectable via a prompt to user when the generator runs.
